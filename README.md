# JEK Framework.
JEK is a small framework meant to follow the conventions an MVC structure gains, which is safer, easier to write code.

There's no **official** documentation for the framework as of now, but there's a fair amount of documentation in the files of the framework, if you know OOP well enough, you'll be able to understand the framework just by reading the code-base!
