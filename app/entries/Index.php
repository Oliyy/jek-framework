          This is the index <b>Entry</b>, located at <b>/app/entries/Index.php</b>, and Kontrolled by <b>/app/kontrollers/IndexKontroller.php</b>

          I'm so bad at documentation, I don't know what to write I'm bad with design, but there's like a bazillion lines of code that
          are beautiful I guess, there's a bunch of stuff but not sure how to represent it without yeah.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess take a look at:
            <ul>
              <li>/sys/build/*all files (most have good documentation in the code base itself)</li>
              <li>I guess learn the CLI side of this, if you don't know what CLI is how'd  you even get this far (GOOGLE IT SON!)</li>
              <li>Wish I had someone to do docuemtation..</li>
              <li>Read the root file /structure.txt, there's some good documentation there, as well as the Markup README file on Github, always being updated!</li>
              <li>Look at the /sys/main classes.</li>
            </ul>
